## Configuration file for Pupistry.


# The following settings apply for all use cases of Pupistry and must be set
general:

  # We need somewhere to cache files like archives and git repos. This will
  # be as big as the total size of all your git repos when being used to
  # build artifacts. Agent-only systems will be far smaller as it only includes
  # the latest version of the artifacts.
  app_cache: ~/.pupistry/cache

  # Some users like to use Pupistry with a non-AWS S3 endpoint such as Minio
  # which requires setting an alternative endpoint below. DO NOT UNCOMMENT IF
  # USING STANDARD AWS S3.
  # s3_endpoint: s3.notaws.example.com
  
  # The S3 bucket must be set in order to have a place to push and
  # pull artifact and manifests from. This bucket should be PRIVATE, we
  # only want your servers accessing the files!
  #
  # REMEMBER - S3 buckets are a global namespace, other people might have
  # already picked the name you want. Make sure you update this default
  # with something you actually own :-)
  s3_bucket: example

  # S3 prefix is entirely optional, useful if you're reusing/sharing an S3
  # bucket with other applications. Leave blank if not needed.
  s3_prefix:

  # GPG key to use for signing & validating the artifacts. It is possible to
  # run pupistry in an unsigned mode, but you will lose the protection against
  # someone with access to the S3 bucket tampering with the files and pushing
  # malicious puppet manifests to your servers
  gpg_disable: true
  gpg_signing_key: XXXXXX
  # Whether to install public key if missing from keychain or not
  gpg_manage_pubkey: true


# Settings for agents, these are required on the machines that will be
# downloading and applying artifacts but also need to be set for build
# machines so we can popular bootstrap templates for you and automatically
# check stuff like IAM permissions before you roll your hosts.
agent:
  # Puppet3 doesn't care what this is, but if using Puppet4, you need to set it
  # to /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments otherwise it blows up.
  puppetcode: /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments

  # The AWS credentials with READ permission to the S3 bucket for downloading
  # artifact files. If unset, we try to figure it out from any AWS creds
  access_key_id:
  secret_access_key:
  region: ap-southeast-2
  proxy_uri:

  # (If Daemonised)
  # Default is to check for a new artifact every 60 seconds, but only to
  # actually run Puppet if there has been a change to the artifact contents.
  # 
  # At a polling rate of 60 seconds, the cost of S3 will be about $0.02 per
  # month per system running Pupistry.
  #
  # If you want to force regular Puppet runs regardless whether or not a new
  # artifact has been released, turn daemon_minimal off, but make sure the
  # frequency isn't too low - 300 seconds+ recommended otherwise Puppet will
  # be hammering your system resources.
  daemon_frequency: 60
  daemon_minimal: true


# The following settings are only needed on the build machines (people building
# new artifacts) and are not needed on the actual agent servers that will be
# downloading and applying them.
build:

  # Define the Git repo for the Puppet manifest & r10k data
  # (ie repo where your Puppetfile & site.pp is)
  puppetcode: git@github.com:jethrocarr/pupistry-samplepuppet.git


  # The AWS credentials with write permission to the S3 bucket for uploading
  # new artifact files. If unset, we try to figure it out from any AWS creds
  # set in the environmnt, but you're best to make it explicit here to avoid
  # surprises....

  # Enable the HieraCrypt feature
  #
  # Note - Once enabled, all your servers must have their definition added,
  # otherwise they will not recieve any Hiera information as it will no longer
  # be delivered in an unencrypted form.
  #
  # You will want to run `pupistry hieracrypt --generate` on each node to
  # generate a file which needs to be saved into `hieracrypt/nodes/hostname`
  # in your puppetcode repo (right alongside the `hieradata/` directory).
  #
  # If you later decide to disable hieracrypt, you should remove the entire 
  # `hieracrypt` directory to avoid confusion.
